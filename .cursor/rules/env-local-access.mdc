# Environment File Access Rules

## .env.local File Access Restriction

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT attempt to access or read `.env.local` files as they are blocked by `.cursorignore` and `.gitignore` configurations.

### What NOT to do:
- Do not use `read_file` tool on `.env.local`
- Do not use `file_search` to look for `.env.local`
- Do not use `grep_search` on `.env.local`
- Do not waste time trying to access environment files that are intentionally hidden

### What TO do instead:
- Ask the user directly for environment variable values if needed
- Reference environment variables by their expected names (e.g., `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- Assume environment variables are properly configured when writing code
- Focus on code implementation rather than configuration file access

### Reasoning:
Environment files contain sensitive information (API keys, secrets, database URLs) and are intentionally excluded from version control and AI access for security reasons.
